Past Coding projects

These are some of the projects that I've made in the past few years and code that I still kept. The .html files are 2D games that I 
made with javascript and using a game engine called phaser.
Other projects include some arduino code where I made a control panel for a RGB strip and also my team's APSC 101 claw design code.
